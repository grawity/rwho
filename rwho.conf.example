# Whether to completely block anonymous queries. (Default: false)
# The usefulness of this setting is questionable:
#  - Currently only the Finger UI implements this setting, denying access
#    to any source not listed in 'trusted_nets', but you can achieve the
#    same using firewall rules.
#  - The web UI only hides the rhost from anonymous queries, exactly as
#    if 'hide_rhost' were set. Use web server configuration to completely
#    deny anonymous access to web UI.
